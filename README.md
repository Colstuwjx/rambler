# rambler

A simple and language-independent SQL schema migration tool

## Installation

Go users can simply compile it from source and install it as a go executable using the following command :

```
go install github.com/elwinar/rambler
```

Others will have to wait for me to have time to cross-compile the executablesâ€¦ nothing really fancy (thank to golang), but not done yet.

## Man

Rambler provide a very succinct interface composed of 2 commands: `apply` and `reverse`.

Both commands share the same set of flags:

* `driver` to choose the driver to use. Available values: "mysql".
* `protocol` to set the communication protocol. Defaults to "tcp". Available values: "tcp".
* `host,h` to set the database server hostname. Defaults to "localhost".
* `port` to set the database server listening port. Defaults to 3306.
* `user,u` to set the database server connection user. Defaults to "root".
* `password,p` to set the database server password. Defaults to "".
* `database,d` to set the database name.
* `migrations,m` to set the migrations directory. Defaults to ".".
* `quiet,q` to suppress non-error output.
* `verbose,v` to display additional informations while running.
* `help` to display help about the current command.

### `Apply`

Apply will execute the first available and not already applied migration's `up` sections.

Options:

* `all,a` to apply all available and not applied migrations in version order

### `Reverse`

Reverse will execute the last applied migration's `down` sections.

Options:

* `all,a` to reverse all applied migrations in version order
